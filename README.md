This is the second assignment completed for my OOP module in the first year of my Computer Science degree.
The aim of this project was to improve upon the News Classifier created in the first assignment by working around some of TF-IDF's limitations using more advanced techniques.
GloVe Embedding and various Machine Learning Processes were used for this, to give the Classifier a more organic understanding of langauge, allowing articles to be better classified
The grade achieved for this assignment was 30/30
